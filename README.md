# Breath of the Wild Database
This is a web gui for a mongodb consisting of all the items found in Zelda Breath of the Wild.


# Information
## I just want the database!
Database is located under `backend/MongoDB-Collection.json`

## How was this built?
I am using a simple node.js app to retrieve a JSON response for the database.

# Updates!
```diff
+ Added web GUI
+ Added mongoDB database collection
+ Added javascript search
+ Added readme
```

# Future?
I plan to see about creating different UI's for the app. The backend is the most important part in order to create a API for the items in the game.
